#The number that has the fewest numbers smaller than it and that are coprime to it (and thus n/phi(n) will be maximal) is a number that is the product of as many consecutive primes as possible
#So up to 10 it will be 6 = 2*3, up to 100 it will be 30 = 2*3*5 and so on.
#Up to 1000000 it will be 510510 = 2*3*5*7*11*13*1.

#Answer = 510510
